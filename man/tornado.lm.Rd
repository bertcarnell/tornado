\usage{
\method{tornado}{lm}(model, type = "PercentChange", alpha = 0.1, dict = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a model object}

\item{type}{\code{PercentChange}, \code{percentiles}, \code{ranges}, or \code{StdDev}}

\item{alpha}{the level of change, the percentile level, or the number of standard deviations}

\item{dict}{a dictionary to translate variables for the plot.  The dictionary
must be a list or data.frame with elements \code{old} and \code{new}.  The
\code{old} element must contain each variable in the model.}

\item{...}{further arguments, not used}
}
\value{
a \code{tornado_plot} object
\item{type}{the type of tornado plot}
\item{data}{the data required for the plot}
\item{family}{the model family if available}
}
\description{
A tornado plot is a visualization of the range of outputs expected
from a variety of inputs, or alternatively, the sensitivity of the output to the
range of inputs.  The center of the tornado is plotted at the response
expected from the mean of each input variable.  For a given variable, the width
of the tornado is determined by the range of the variable, a multiplicative factor
of the variable, or a quantile of the variable.  Variables are ordered vertically
with the widest bar at the top and narrowest at the bottom.  Only one variable
is moved from its mean value at a time.  Factors or categorical variables have also
been added to these plots by plotting dots at the resulting output as each
factor is varied through all of its levels.  The base factor level is chosen
as the input variable for the center of the tornado.
